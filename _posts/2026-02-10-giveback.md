## 0 — Preparation on Attacker

### Environment Setup

Add a convenient hosts entry (optional):

```bash
echo "10.10.11.94 giveback.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**Why this matters:** While you can work directly with the IP address, using the hostname makes commands more readable and matches the certificate/virtual host configuration that WordPress may require.

Open multiple terminal panes and keep listeners ready. Replace ATTACKER_IP below with your machine IP (e.g. 10.10.14.81).

**Pro tip:** Use tmux or screen to manage multiple shells simultaneously. You'll need at least three terminal windows: one for listeners, one for executing exploits, and one for notes/monitoring.

## 1 — Recon (Quick Commands)

### Network Service Discovery

Nmap to discover services (example):

```bash
nmap -sV -A 10.10.11.94 -oA nmap/giveback
```

**What to look for:**
- Port 80/443 (HTTP/HTTPS) running WordPress
- Any unusual high-numbered ports that might indicate internal services
- Version numbers of web servers (Apache, nginx) that might have known vulnerabilities
- Response timing that suggests firewalls or IDS/IPS systems

### WordPress-Specific Enumeration

Sensible web enumeration with WP-specific tooling:

```bash
wpscan --url http://giveback.htb --enumerate u,p,t --output wpscan.txt
```

**Expected findings:**
- WordPress version information
- The GiveWP donation plugin (critical finding)
- robots.txt pointing to /wp-admin/
- Potentially exposed user accounts
- Theme information that might reveal additional attack surface

**Notes:** You should find WordPress, the give (GiveWP) plugin and robots.txt pointing to /wp-admin/. The presence of GiveWP version 3.14.1 or earlier is your key entry point.
