## Hey, I'm Andrés 👋

Offensive security enthusiast and HackTheBox player. I break things — responsibly — and document every step along the way.

### What You'll Find Here

🔍 **Detailed HTB Writeups** — Step-by-step walkthroughs of HackTheBox machines covering reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and beyond.

🛡️ **Real-World Techniques** — Each writeup mirrors a real pentest engagement: from initial scanning to root flag, with every command documented.

🔒 **Premium Content** — Full exploitation paths, PoC code, and remediation notes are available to [members](https://whop.com/andres-411f/). Free previews cover the recon phase so you can see the methodology before committing.

### My Approach

I believe the best way to learn cybersecurity is by doing. Every writeup follows a structured methodology:

1. **Reconnaissance** — Port scanning, service enumeration, attack surface mapping
2. **Enumeration** — Deep-dive into services, web apps, and configurations
3. **Exploitation** — Identifying and leveraging vulnerabilities for initial access
4. **Privilege Escalation** — Moving from user to root through misconfigurations and exploits
5. **Documentation** — Clean, reproducible commands with explanations
